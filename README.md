# Stori Take Home Test - Project interface

## Requirements

- Use of a HTTP request library (`Python` `Requests`, `CURL`, etc) or a GUI API testing tool (`Postman`, `Insomnia`, etc).
- Active Internet connection.
- *Real email address account* able to receive messages.

## Steps

1. Create an user.
2. Get an email with user's summary.
3. Call for transaction's JSON or download CSV file.
4. Repeat with a new user.

Note:

- All calls should be made to this base url: `https://rqva7y6toj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/stori-take-home-test`
- Beware that all endpoint urls have ending trailing slash.

  "txs": 473
}
```

### Get an email with user's summary

    "owner_id": 1,
    "amount": "-307.17",
    "date": "2022-01-01 09:15:36.000000"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "owner_id": 1,
    "amount": "-77.6",
    "date": "2022-01-01 18:31:12.000000"
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "owner_id": 1,
    "amount": "-129.53",
    "date": "2022-01-04 02:04:48.000000"
  },
  ...
  ]
}
```

## Other endpoints

- `GET: /user/{user_id}/`
- `DELETE: /user/{user_id}/`



## Caveats & Known issues
- Database is non-persistent, so any user/transactions created will be deleted after a short time window. If you want to try again, please start over.
- Email is sent through sender address `no-reply@wem.mx`. Please look into Junk/spam folder if mail is not into inbox.
- `send-email` endpoint is the 'slowest'. I made another project on the fly to process and generate the chart located at the bottom of the email message. This connection is a VPS outside AWS ecosystem.
- *CSV file is downloading wrongly enconded in base64 â€”you could decode it to confirm. Didn't got time to debbug this properly.
